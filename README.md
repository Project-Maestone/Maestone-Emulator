<!-- Introduction -->
## Introduction


Maestone is an attempt to revive the game "Maestia Rise of Keledus", which has been offline since 2016.

Here's why:
Maestia was developed by Bigpoint in 2010 and brought to the European market by ProsiebenSat.1 Group under the title Maestia: The Shattered Light. The starting point of the development around 2010 was the game known as "Homage Genesis" or "Homage", which originated in Korea and Japan. However, the development of the game with the name "Homage" began in 2006. In 2012, the game was taken over by Alaplaya and fundamentally revised. The title of the game from then on was Maestia: Rise of Keledus. At this time, the studio in which Maestia was further developed also changed. After a major dissatisfaction with the current developer due to lack of communication and work necessary to maintain the game, the publisher changed again in mid-2014. This time, Aeria Games was supposed to try its luck and continued to fail with the current developer due to the aforementioned issues. As official sources report, the developer already withdrew in 2014 and thus, even after longer attempts to maintain the game, it was clear in February 2016 that Maestia will go offline. According to individual gamemods, quality assurance testers and support staff employed by publishers, the fall of Maestia was announced early on.

Due to the negative End which can be traced back to the withdrawal of the developer, the number of players naturally decreased as well. Despite all this, Maestia had a very strong community on the European and American servers for which it is worthwhile to enforce a revive.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites - Windows

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Visual Studio 2019 - For running and editing the server
* 2015 Client - A 2015 version of the game client
* Git - For cloning the Repository

### Start Server

1. Clone the repository first

2. Open the DevServer Solution File 

3. Simply start the Debugger



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Client Setup

We found the Client here: 
First, the client must be prepared for the following steps are necessary 

1. Download the Client
You can find the client [Here] https://download.project-maestone.info/

2. Unzip the Client
   
3. (optional) The IP address of the server is set to 127.0.0.1. If you are interested in changing this, then these changes must be set in prop.ini which can be found in the Data folder. For this you only need to look into the root directory of the Maestia client folder
   
4. (option 1) Create a Shortcut from the Maestia.exe, add the following string to the Destination.

  You have to change [password] to your password which can be found in the LoginHandler in row 82. The marked part is the [password] In the current devserver the password is 1234, so it should look like this: `èÑÐ[ýÅÓA@1234`
